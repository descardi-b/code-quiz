# 🌸 welcome to my coding quiz! 🌸 

here's a quiz all about coding that i developed for the UC Berkeley full stack development course. <br /><br />

in this assignment, i was tasked with:
<br /><br />

🍓 creating a dynamic and interactive quiz with a countdown timer <br />
🍓 storing all user scores and the current high score to local storage <br />
🍓 retrieving these scores from local storage to then dynamically add them to the webpage <br /><br />
🍓 designing the webpage to be responsive <br /><br />

here are some screenshots of my work:
